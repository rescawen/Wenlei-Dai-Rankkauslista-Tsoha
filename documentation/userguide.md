# User guide

## How does the application work?

The applications main features are managing tournament as an administrator as well as joing and playing in a tournament as player.

Once logged in you see three lists of tournaments, one for all the tournaments that you have joined, another for all the tournaments available and lastly the ones that you have created and manage. You can also click their respective links at the navigation bar at the top which takes you into a page with pagination that lists all of the tournamnents.

## How to use the basic features?

Once you land on the page as a new user, you can immediately see a list of all the latest tournaments. The number to the right of the tournament name enclosed in pill bubble refers to the amount of players in the tournament. If the number is in x/y format then it means the tournament is still in registration and if it is a single number format then it is the final amount of players participating in an already started tournament.

Clicking tournament will take you into the tournament specific page. In the tournament specific page you can see the names of the players who have signed up.

If you are the tournament creator you can go into the editpage where you can delete or edit modify the tournament before it begins.

The creator of the tournament can start the tournament with at least 1 player or with maximum amount of players the creator has set as limit by clicking the `start button`. Once the tournament has started and the bracket is generated, you can hover your mouse in between the two players to reveal the report match button.

Once clicking the report match a modal will animate to the middle of the screen where you can fill in the result for the matches.
The tournament creator has permission to edit all matches and in addition deleting matches. The player can only edit their respective matches that they are in. Deleting matches will cause the bracket to render incorrectly and once all matches have been deleted the tournament goes back to the unstarted state.

Winner and score are purposely designed to be separate as it makes it possible to retain a score, in case the winner of the match cannot continue to play and we want to advance the losing player as replacement for the next match.
