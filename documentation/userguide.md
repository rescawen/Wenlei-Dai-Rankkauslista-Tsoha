Once you land on the page as a new user, you can immediately see a list of all the latest tournaments. The number to the right of the tournament name refers to the amount of players in the tournament. 

Once logged in you see three lists of tournaments, one for all the tournaments that you have joined, another for all the tournaments available and lastly the ones that you have created and manage. 

Clicking tournament will take you into the tournament specific page. In the tournament specific page you can see the names of the players who have signed up and the bracket of the tournament once the tournament has begun. If you are the tournament administrator you have additional edit, delete buttons and also possibility to edit all matches in the tournament. 

Once the tournament has started and the bracket is generated, there is a link to the specific match in the bracket.
