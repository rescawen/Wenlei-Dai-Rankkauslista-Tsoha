# Incomplete Features

## The limitations of the work and application 

## The features that are left out of the work. 

Seeding is completely left out. Seeding should be part of this application to begin with. However usually seeding is done by a combination of "ladder" ranking and "tournament" ranking if it is done properly. It is usually the admins job to manually to search for these and especially put the highest ranked players on opposite side of bracket when there is prizes involved. 

The technical of way of implementing seeding would be to create the matches empty without players in it. In our case the unique player IDs, then depending on the seeding we manually insert the players who highest to opposite sides of bracket and continue this until all the players are inserted. 

## Future development plans

Ideally the perfect way is to have the "Ranking websites/servers" plug their data into the tournament system and then there wouldn't manual labour seeding. There would be recommended seeding and admin can just confirm or slightly tweak it before starting the tournament.

## How accurate is the documentation planning to the actual final code

Due to the fact that this application is straight forward from a user perspective, the orginal plans are very much represented in the final work.
